Oklahoma Historical Society, sponsor",Documentation compiled after 1933,"-  Significance: This Second Renaissance Revival structure was the scene of numerous historic events: the inauguration of both the last of the territorial governors and the first Governor of Statehood Oklahoma. The second Carnegie library in Oklahoma, it grew from the efforts of the organizers of one of the earliest libraries in Oklahoma, to which it is successor. It is remarkable for the number of ways in which it diverges from Andrew Carnegie's ideas of what a library building should be.
